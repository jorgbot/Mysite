					<h3>LeadFlash Redesign</h3>
					<p>We were finally allowed to redesign the company site at work. Like most corporate site redesigns there were a lot of opinions flying around the board room and each exec had their own ideas on what our new site was going to look like. We must have went through forty rounds of mock-ups and wireframs before we reached a consensus on one design. Now that it is all said and done and the site is launched, I am happy with the end result. Definitely brought the company site into the modern age. Check out the <a href="">before</a> and <a href="">after</a>. </p>

					<h3>I'm Getting Married!</h3>
					<p>I met the love of my life at my current job in 2013. We hit it off and by October of this year we will be a married couple. I was tempted to let her just put together one of those free wedding sites but the web designer in me couldn't let that stand. I had to put it up in a hurry but the fam seemed to dig it. Go ahead...the registry is still live...cough cough (Dyson)</p>
