Finally, I've done it! After years of telling myself that I need to redesign my site I have finally complied and released the new site this morning. I love the way it looks but what I'm most excited about is the new blog. This will allow me an outlet to express my passion for web design and the internet in general. We will dive into new programming languages, cool tutorials, best pratices, and all things web design. I can't wait!  If anyone has any ideas for an article or if you would like to do a guest post [let me know](mailto:david@david-conner.com). In the meantime my first article is going to get into the nitty gritty of Jekyll, the static site generator that powers this blog.
