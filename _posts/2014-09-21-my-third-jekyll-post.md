The third quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog. We were finally allowed to redesign the company site at LeadFlash. Like most corporate site redesigns there were a lot of opinions flying around the board room. The end result was a compromise of executive taste, departmental needs and design aesthetics that I am pretty happy with. We now have an up-to-date, responsive site that is representative of our standing in the industry. The before and after say it all.
